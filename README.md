# hello-world
Hi Github world,

I am a materials scientist working on materials synthesis, characterization, and integration of materials proccessing method into industry. I had six years work experience on atom probe tomography, a technique that can detect millions of atoms within the the materials at the atomic scale. The visualisation of different atoms can be done via commercialized software, like IVAS. But I like to start the Github world to learn the scripts to process such atoms instead of only becoming an advanced user.

Now I am working on the Magnetic Recording industry, performing electron microscopy tests for devices. Detailed imaging process, automation can make my life much easier. I wish through this platform I can gain many valuable experiences from other shared scripts and experienced codes!
